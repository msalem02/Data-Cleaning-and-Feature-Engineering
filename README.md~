# Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

---

## Overview

This repository contains scripts, notebooks, and resources for performing data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering on raw datasets.  
The goal is to transform raw, messy data into clean, structured, and feature-rich datasets ready for modeling and analysis.

---

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw datasets (handle missing values, outliers, duplicates)  
- Engineer new features and transform existing ones (scaling, encoding, interaction terms)  
- Provide reusable pipelines or modules for data preparation  
- Document the methodology, assumptions, and transformation logic

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository  
git clone https://github.com/msalem02/Data-Cleaning-and-Feature-Engineering.git
cd Data-Cleaning-and-Feature-Engineering

### 2. Install Dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Run the Notebooks or Scripts

## Key Processes

### Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values: imputation, deletion, or interpolation  
- Detect and treat outliers  
- Remove duplicates and inconsistent records  
- Correct data types, normalize units, handle date/time  

### Feature Engineering
- Encoding categorical variables (one-hot, ordinal)  
- Scaling / normalization of numerical features  
- Creating interaction terms, polynomial features  
- Feature selection (variance threshold, correlation, importance)  
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, etc.) — if applicable

## Results and Outputs

- Cleaned, processed datasets in data_processed/  
- Transformed feature sets ready for modeling  
- Notebook visualizations and explanations of transformations  
- Optionally, summary statistics or reports (e.g. before vs after cleaning)
